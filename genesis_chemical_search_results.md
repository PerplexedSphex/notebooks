### Owner Company Search
- **No matches found** for "SMART CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS LLC" in RCRA database
- **No direct connections** found between any facilities and this company name

## Analysis & Conclusions

1. **Address Match**: Found exact facility at the target address, but it's registered as "GENISIS LOGISTICS" (not Genesis Chemical)

2. **LQG Status Discrepancy**: The contact claimed 2 LQGs, but the Midland facility (TXR000087000) is registered as "Not a Generator" - this contradicts the LQG claim

3. **Recent Registration**: The Midland facility was just registered on Nov 20, 2024 - very recent, which might explain the discrepancy

4. **Spelling Variation**: "GENISIS" vs "GENESIS" - could be a data entry error or intentional variation

5. **No Owner Connection**: Cannot find SMART CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS LLC in RCRA records

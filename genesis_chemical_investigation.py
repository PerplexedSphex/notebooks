    # Genesis Custom Chemical Blending Investigation

    ## Research Request
    Investigation for @Will Locke regarding Genesis Custom Chemical Blending data review:
    - **Contact claim**: They have 2 LQG facilities
    - **Known facility**: TXR00041780 at 2708 NE Main St, Ennis, TX 75119-8426
    - **TX Registration ID**: 00446861
    - **Second location**: 2400 E County Rd 123, Midland, TX 79706
    - **Owner**: SMART CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS LLC
    - **TCEQ finding**: Only one shipment found in May 2024

    ## Investigation Approach
    1. Search RCRA database for Genesis Chemical facilities
    2. Search for facilities at target Midland address
    3. Search for owner company (Smart Chemical Solutions)
    4. Analyze e-Manifest shipping data
    5. Verify LQG claims with actual waste generation records

    ## Key Findings from RCRA Registration Data

    ### ‚úÖ Confirmed Facilities
    1. **TXR000041780 - Genesis Custom Chemical Blending**
       - Location: Ennis, TX
       - Status: **LQG (Large Quantity Generator)** ‚úÖ
       - Matches known facility information

    2. **TXR000087000 - Genisis Logistics** 
       - Location: **2400 E County Road 123, Midland, TX** ‚úÖ (exact match!)
       - Status: **Not a Generator** ‚ùå (contradicts LQG claim)
       - Registration: November 20, 2024 (very recent!)
       - Contact: Cole Chadsworth, 806-367-8031

    ### ‚ùå Missing Elements
    - **No facilities found** registered to "SMART CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS LLC"
    - **Spelling discrepancy**: "GENISIS" vs "GENESIS" 
    - **Status discrepancy**: Midland facility is "Not a Generator", not LQG

    ### üìù Analysis
    The contact claimed 2 LQG facilities, but RCRA data shows:
    - 1 confirmed LQG (Ennis)
    - 1 facility at target address but registered as "Not a Generator" (Midland)
    - Very recent registration (Nov 2024) suggests possible operational changes

    ## üéØ Final Investigation Results

    ### Confirmed Findings

    **Genesis Custom Chemical Blending (Ennis) - VERIFIED LQG:**
    - ‚úÖ **95 total manifests** (July 2021 - April 2025)  
    - ‚úÖ **Active operations**: 10 shipments in 2025 alone
    - ‚úÖ **LQG volumes**: 7-20 tons per shipment
    - ‚úÖ **Consistent with claim**: This is a legitimate LQG facility

    **Target Midland Address - FACILITY FOUND BUT NO LQG ACTIVITY:**
    - ‚úÖ **Exact address match**: TXR000087000 "Genisis Logistics" at 2400 E County Rd 123
    - ‚ùå **Zero manifest activity**: No waste shipments found in e-Manifest database
    - ‚ùå **Not a Generator status**: RCRA registration shows "N" (Not a Generator)
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Very recent registration**: November 20, 2024 (may indicate operational changes)

    ### Key Discrepancies

    1. **LQG Claim vs Reality**: Contact claimed 2 LQGs, but evidence shows only 1
    2. **Waste Generation**: No e-Manifest evidence of hazardous waste from Midland facility
    3. **Owner Company**: No RCRA records found for "Smart Chemical Solutions LLC"
    4. **TCEQ vs e-Manifest**: TCEQ found 1 shipment (May 2024), e-Manifest shows 0

    ### Recommendations

    1. **Contact TXR000087000** directly (Cole Chadsworth, 806-367-8031):
       - Verify connection to Genesis Custom Chemical Blending
       - Clarify actual waste generation status
       - Understand recent registration (Nov 2024)

    2. **Business relationship verification**:
       - Confirm Smart Chemical Solutions LLC ownership
       - Determine operational relationship between Ennis and Midland locations

    3. **Regulatory status clarification**:
       - Check if Midland facility plans to become LQG
       - Verify current waste management practices

    ### Conclusion
    **The claim of having 2 LQG facilities appears to be unsubstantiated.** While there is a facility at the exact target address, it shows no evidence of hazardous waste generation or shipping activity that would qualify it as an LQG.
